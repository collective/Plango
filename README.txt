Description

    Plango is product that replaces the default Plone Icon Set with the Tango
    Icon set.

    During product installation, a new layer is added to all skins selections
    in the portal_skins tool.
    The new layer corresponds to a folder in portal_skins (named
    'tango_plone_images') which contains icon replacements.

Installation

    Place the product folder in the Products directory of your Zope instance
    and restart the server.

    Go to the 'Site Setup' page in the Plone interface and click on the
    'Add/Remove Products' link.

    Choose the product (check its checkbox) and click the 'Install' button.

    Uninstall -- This can be done from the same management screen.
